    "Use Case: In this project i will set up agents that can be used to onboard users into a live chat system like the one you can find on an online app like your banking website or your phone provider website. I will set up an agents to gather specifc information about a user that needs help, and then pass that information to human that will directly have a clear understanding of who requires help, where they're from and what their problem is, so that the human can immediately act on this information and help the user.\n",

    "1. An **Onboarding Personal Information Agent**: this agent's goal is to get the name and location of the customer.\n",
    "2. An **Onboarding Issue Agent**: this agent's goal is to determine what the issue of the customer is.\n",
    "3. A  **Customer Engagement Agent**: this agent will interact with the customer until a human agent can start interacting with the customer."
